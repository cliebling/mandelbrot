mandel.cpp

Generates an image of a mandelbrot set.
The image is animated; the position of the mouse
changes the value of Z that is used to generate
the set.

Click in the window to exit.
See the source for command line options.

Build with:
g++ -lSDL2 -std=c++17 mandel.cpp -o mandel

I wrote this because I haven't written any C++ in
quite some time. C++ 17 is very different from
the C++ I learned in 2002. Who'd have thought?
